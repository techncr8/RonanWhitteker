  "body": "### The Art Gallery\r\nThe premises is to be facilitated by [LIVS](http://livs.org.nz/). The primary purpose of the space is to provide a focal point for the emerging digital art scene in Christchurch, New Zealand. This involves facilities for the presentation and sale of artworks and literature around Digital Art and Futurist Philosophies.\r\n\r\n### The Meeting Place\r\nOur goal is to establish an IRL community under the moniker of [strategies.group](http://strategies.group). This is essentially a think tank based around bringing forth the post-political world and preparing for the singularity.\r\n\r\n### Learning Facilities\r\nWe hope to continue holding meetings for the broader arts communities here and implement our already funded workshop series in the topics of Digital Arts and Digital Humanities. After that we will work toward holding full-time courses based on the model of the [School For Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io).\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nFor more information contact our administrator at technocr8@gmail.com\r\n",
